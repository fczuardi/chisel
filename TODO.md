From the [original Forrst post](http://forrst.com/posts/Colapsable_Forrst_Timeline_experimental_mod-L55)

* bug: when you click on the heart to like an expanded item, it is currently collapsing the item sometimes, It shouldn't.
* idea: be able to se a short snippet of the text on collapsed items.
* idea: prevent the loading of the images before expanding the item, in order to load faster and save bandwidth for phone users.
* idea: use CSS transitions to animate the expand / collapse
* idea: show a "next item" link, similar to GReader when the item is expanded
